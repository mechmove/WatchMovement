This is a sample template file that needs to be followed precisely to define your geartrain.
Do NOT include any comments or extra lines, this is a structured file.

There are 2 types of gears, "Base", and "InnerGear". 

All parms need to be listed, even if they do not have values. Exception, the following keys need to set to "false" all the time, unless they are driving or being driven by another connected gear:

BaseTeethDrivenBy=false
BaseTeethDriving=false
InnerTeethDriving=false
InnerTeethDrivenBy=false

Please consult included (working) gear trains to see how it works.
